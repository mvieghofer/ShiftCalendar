Vision
======
Currently it might be hard to add shifts of shift workers to the Google Calendar. It is especially hard when the shifts do not occur on a regular basis, as it might be for nurses. The aim of this project is to create a Google Chrome App that provides the functionality to define custom shift types and apply them to multiple days at once.
