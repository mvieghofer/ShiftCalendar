Vision
======
The process of adding a shift schedule to your Google Calendar is currently not optimal (especially if the shifts have always the same start and end time). You either have to create each event on its own or you need to search for the last time the same shift type you want to add occured and duplicate it. It would be much easier, if it would be possible to define a few shift types that have predefined start and end times and add them to your calendar for multiple days at once.

About this App
==============
This app tries to accomplish this. You can define your shift types that have a start time, a end time and a name and add them to your Google Calendar of choice for multiple days at once. If you want to see a demo, go to http://mvieghofer.github.io/ShiftCalendar.

Next Steps
==========
Currently the only next planned step is a new user interface design. If you have any suggestions for new features, please go to https://github.com/mvieghofer/ShiftCalendar/issues and add them there.
